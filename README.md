### David Jump

Currently, I am student at Colorado State University. In December, I am completing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering with a minor in computer science. One of my goals with this degree is to learn how to develop software that brings value to individuals. As a student most of my web development exposure has been with Microsoft products, languages and frameworks. I have worked on ASP .NET MVC projects, and RESTful services. These projects used IIS, C#, Microsoft SQL and, MySQL on the server side and the views on the client side being built using Razor, HTML,JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap. Most of source control experience is with TFS. Currently, I do not have much experience with many of the topics in CS314 but I look forward to learning how to use all the languages, and tools.

# Manifesto

* We will use tested, working, and deployable software to track our progress and success. This is expected at all times of development, but especially as we approach the end of the sprint. We want to be focused on delivering bug free software that works at any given time. By using working versions as an incremental way of tracking our progress, we will ensure that we achieve this. We will have a deployable system at all times, and in particular, the last few days of the sprint will be spent ensuring tests pass, code is clean, and we have made progress as defined above.
