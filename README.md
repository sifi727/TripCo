### David Jump

Currently, I am student at Colorado State University. In December, I am completing a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering with a minor in computer science. One of my goals with this degree is to learn how to develop software that brings value to individuals. As a student most of my web development exposure has been with Microsoft products, languages and frameworks. I have worked on ASP .NET MVC projects, and RESTful services. These projects used IIS, C#, Microsoft SQL and, MySQL on the server side and the views on the client side being built using Razor, HTML,JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap. Most of source control experience is with TFS. Currently, I do not have much experience with many of the topics in CS314 but I look forward to learning how to use all the languages, and tools.

### Alex Laswell

I am a Colorado native, I grew up in and around Loveland and Fort Collins. I am a dad to two boys (ages 6 and 8) and a yellow lab (also 6). We live in town, under the giant ‘A’ (for Alex). I am only two classes (including this one) away from completing my BA in Computer Science!!

My hobbies include watching anime, biking, camping, computers, food, football, hiking, netflix binging, pokémon, and video games (mostly First Person Shooters, but also Mario, Zelda, etc). My favourite colour is green, and I love all kinds of music from heavy metal to pop, in both English and Spanish. 

# Manifesto

* We will use tested, working, and deployable software to track our progress and success. This is expected at all times of development, but especially as we approach the end of the sprint. We want to be focused on delivering bug free software that works at any given time. By using working versions as an incremental way of tracking our progress, we will ensure that we achieve this. We will have a deployable system at all times, and in particular, the last few days of the sprint will be spent ensuring tests pass, code is clean, and we have made progress as defined above.
* It is okay to disagree with each other, but as a team we will respect one another and help each other succeed.
* When it comes to our development practices, we will strive for both accurrecy and percision, rather than acheiving either one or the other.

# Expectations

* All work must be tracked and accounted for. Each branch will have a correspoding issue and each pull request will be associated to a branch. We will never commit directly to the master branch.
* Every member is expected to finish the work they commit to. If a member is experiencing difficulty in completing their task, and have put in an effort, then they should ask the rest of the team for help.
