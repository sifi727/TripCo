### David Jump

Currently, I am student at Colorado State University. In December, I am completing a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer engineering with a minor in computer science. One of my goals with this degree is to learn how to develop software that brings value to individuals. As a student most of my web development exposure has been with Microsoft products, languages and frameworks. I have worked on ASP .NET MVC projects, and RESTful services. These projects used IIS, C#, Microsoft SQL and, MySQL on the server side and the views on the client side being built using Razor, HTML,JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap. Most of source control experience is with TFS. Currently, I do not have much experience with many of the topics in CS314 but I look forward to learning how to use all the languages, and tools.
