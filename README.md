### Melvin Gramke
I have lived here in Fort Collins for almost 6 years now. Previously, I lived in Montrose for just over a year and prior to that in Florida, where it snows less frequently. I am an undergraduate here at Colorado State, and my major is in Computer Science. I have one year to go before graduation, and I am currently employed with CSU Facilities. I enjoy biking and CSU pickup soccer as well as listening to audiobooks, podcasts, and music. My favorite aspect of Computer Science is logical analysis and algorithms.

### David Jump

Currently, I am student at Colorado State University. In December, I am completing a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering with a minor in computer science. One of my goals with this degree is to learn how to develop software that brings value to individuals. As a student most of my web development exposure has been with Microsoft products, languages and frameworks. I have worked on ASP .NET MVC projects, and RESTful services. These projects used IIS, C#, Microsoft SQL and, MySQL on the server side and the views on the client side being built using Razor, HTML,JavaScript, Angular, Bootstrap. Most of source control experience is with TFS. Currently, I do not have much experience with many of the topics in CS314 but I look forward to learning how to use all the languages, and tools.

### Alex Laswell

I am a Colorado native, I grew up in and around Loveland and Fort Collins. I am a dad to two boys (ages 6 and 8) and a yellow lab (also 6). We live in town, under the giant ‘A’ (for Alex). I am only two classes (including this one) away from completing my BA in Computer Science!!

My hobbies include watching anime, biking, camping, computers, food, football, hiking, netflix binging, pokémon, and video games (mostly First Person Shooters, but also Mario, Zelda, etc). My favourite colour is green, and I love all kinds of music from heavy metal to pop, in both English and Spanish. 

### Jerrel Siler

I am originally from the east coast and lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for most of my life in a town southeast of Pittsburgh called McKeesport. I am currently majoring in two degrees: Computer Science and Applied Computing Technology. I have been in Colorado since August 2010 and before that, I lived in Georgia for nearly seven years in the city of Columbus. I developed a passion for computers once I was out of high school and I have always enjoyed math when I was younger, so computer science fits well with what I wanted to do as a career.

As for my hobbies, well I love being behind a computer (obviously) whether it is surfing the web, playing games (I currently like to play Terraria by the way), or even working on personal computing projects. Also when time and money allows it, I love to travel and visit new places. Colorado is the furtherest west that I have been in the US, so eventually I would like to travel west to visit California and Las Vegas!

# Manifesto

* We will use tested, working, and deployable software to track our progress and success. This is expected at all times of development, but especially as we approach the end of the sprint. We want to be focused on delivering bug free software that works at any given time. By using working versions as an incremental way of tracking our progress, we will ensure that we achieve this. We will have a deployable system at all times, and in particular, the last few days of the sprint will be spent ensuring tests pass, code is clean, and we have made progress as defined above.
* Each member on the team will respect one another and help each other succeed.  We recognize it is okay to disagree with each other. When we have disagreements we will discuss them on Slack or in a meeting. If the disagreement is major and cannot be resolved we will bring up the ideas objectivity to the TA so we as team can learn what the best course of action is. If the TA does not know then we will talk with Dave. 
* When it comes to our development practices, we will strive for both accuracy and precision, rather than acheiving either one or the other. We recognize that being both accurate and precise will always lead to meeting our developement goals. Being only accurate may occasionally leave us short from hitting our developement goals while being only precise may always lead to not reaching our development goals.
* We take a dynamic approach to specifications implementation. We will strive to continually adopt each requirements modification during every stage of development. We will use process management tools in a collaborative environment to ensure consistent, effective, and efficient development practices that allow timely changes and that maintains consistency within the requirements specification framework. 

# Expectations


* All work must be tracked and accounted for. Each branch will have a correspoding issue and each pull request will be associated to a branch. We will never commit directly to the master branch. 
* All pull requests must have at least two reviewers aproving it before the new branch is merged into the master branch. The last reviewer that approves the branch will merge it into the master branch.
* Every member is expected to finish the work they commit to. If a member is experiencing difficulty in completing their task, and have put in an effort, then they should ask the rest of the team for help.
