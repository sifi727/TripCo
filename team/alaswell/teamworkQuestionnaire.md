# Teamwork Questionnaire for Alex Laswell

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * text - pretty much anytime between 7am and 10pm
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * everything ... I expect that we will be able to do what is assigned and accomplish the goals each sprint
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * To get better at working with people and taking criticism (especially on my code)
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Time constraints, personal issues, our team may not work well together, etc.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We will have to have a discussion as a team and come to an understanding we all are ok with. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I want to say no here, but honestly I am that team member that will do that so it kinda has to be. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * At least an hour a day from each member
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * we will decide as a team during the sprint planning 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * _stuff_ happens, but it needs to be documented to ensure it is not happening all the time, and we need to have a plan to accomidate these kinds of things so that we still remain on track as a team. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think that if anyone is unhappy with the quality of the work, we should try to fix whatever it is they are not happy with. Provided it is not something minuscule, and everyone else on the team veto's it.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as your commitment is met each sprint, I could care less how you do it. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it would be beneficial to schedule a retrospective each week, outside of class, on top of the "standup" at the end of class each day.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At least once per week, for a retrospecitve, and then more if we have urgent issues or something. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think this very much depends on the type of decision. If we are talking a variable name or file name or something. Just do it and make PR and someone else can review. For something like design decision or major changes to functionality though, we should probably have a discussion on slack or something.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Majority rules
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * We will need to have a discussion and divy up some of the work.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will propose a meeting and express my feelings to the team so that we may have a discussion about it.
