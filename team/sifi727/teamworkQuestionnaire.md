5.  What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
    o	I think that all of the team members will strive for the A.  We will try the best we can.
    
6.  Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
    o	I feel that everyone should do equal amount of work.  But then again, the equal amount of work can be measured differently according to each team member’s capabilities.
    
7.  How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
    o	Depends on the workload.  AT minumum, I say at least 10 hours a week; however, personally I say at least 14 hours a week minimum (2 hours a day in a 7-day week schedule).
    
8.  How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
    o	We should look at each team member’s strengths and weaknesses and then try our best to assign roles according to each teammate’s ability.

    o	We will have to discuss it as a group.
    
11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
    o	As long as it does not interfere with the quality or getting the project finish on the deadline, then this should not be an issue.

12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
    o	Yes, at least once a week.
13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
    o	Depends how much that we have to get done and whether each team member understands their assignment.

    o	Yes, in 97% of the decisions.
    
15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
    o	As a group, we would try to resolve the difference with the disagreeing team member.  if it is severely impeding our progress, then we as a group will get one of the TA involved. And at worst case and last resort we contact the instructor.

16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
    o	Depends, if he or she is leading us in the right direction, then I personally will not have any issues.
    
What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
    o	I would contact the group and see if I can work something out to spread out the responsibilities more equally.
