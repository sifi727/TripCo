Teamwork Questionnaire for Melvin Gramke

    Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else? What hours?
        email. The morning hours are best.
    What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
        Experience with development tools and development processes in a collaborative environment.
    What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
        To learn as much as I can from team members and to make productive contributions to accomplish team goals.
    What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
        Difficulties in communications, decision making, and goal setting among team members.
    What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
        The team will need to work diligently to achieve either result.
    Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
        No, each member has a responsibility to complete their assigned work, and should collaborate with others in order to overcome difficulties.
    How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
        10 hours perhaps.
    How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
        Try to match interests and skills / abilities with identified tasks.
    What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
        The team should be notified prior to the commitment deadline; otherwise, the person will need to take responsibility for any missed deadline / incompleted tasks.
    What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
        The team should achieve consensus regarding the range of quality that is expected as tasks are assigned, and members should be held to agreed upon standards.
    How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
        Team members should briefly provide regular status updates during weekly meetings to reconcile progression among members.
    Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
        That would be great, I am open to scheduling a time that works for each member.
    How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
        2 or 3 times per week seems feasible.
    Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
        Sometimes, depending on the circumstances; however, generally, I don't think that is necessary.
    What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
        The team should determine which path is most consistent with the requirements of the associated task and if necessary, consider the requirements of associated tasks and overall project requirements.
    What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
        If necessary, team members should discuss their concerns in order to increase situational awareness.
    What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
        Try to communicate your perspective to team members in order to identify mitigating steps that could be taken.
