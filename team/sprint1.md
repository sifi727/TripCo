# Sprint 1 - *t07* - *Team double 07*

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: *David Jump*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint1.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *RESTful Service for Distance*
* *Responsive Client for Distance Calculator*

Planning Decisions the team made.

* On Friday we as team copied the tasks which were setup in the tripco repository. We then, discussed each task and then rated how complex we thought each task would be using the Fibonacci number sequence. Then, each member on the team chose the task(s) they felt comfortable completing by the end the sprint.

* Since this is the first time the team has worked together on a sprint we also met on Saturday and reviewed how the current code worked to help insure everyone was still comfortable with the tasks they had chosen on Friday. We also tentatively set a meeting for Wednesday after class because we knew the different parts of the code would need to work together and it is faster to figure out problems when we are physically together.

* On Wednesday we worked together and made decisions to revert changes which happen in auto generated files and we polished up the code before merging it into master.

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* RESTful Service for Distance
* Responsive Client for Distance Calculator

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* Currently waiting on the next sprint to create new epics

#### What went well
* Everyone in the team contributed to different parts in the sprint.
* Everyone in the team provided useful correction to code before it was merged into the master branch.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Some of the original code purposed to be merged into the master branch did not compile. This was found and fixed before it was merged.
* Because of the lack of mock up during the planning phase some code was merged into the master branch that would not compile. This was fixed promptly when it was discovered.
* Some code was complex and was hard to read in the first purposed pull request. This was fixed by refactoring the code into a more readable format.


## Retrospective

#### What went well
* The planning and delegating went good. And following through on our commitments and working with each other to polish each branch.
* Meeting up as a team went well whether it was meeting after classes for an hour or so and on occasions meeting on the weekends when we needed to also went pretty good.

#### Potential improvements
* Figuring out the best way to mock out an object during the planning phase so other developers can use a method currently being built in the current sprint and still have their code compile.
* Reserving a room for our meeting would be beneficial so we can start the meeting on time and do not have to worry about if the equipment will work.

#### What we will change next time
* Reserving a room.
* Discuss ways to implement the code so teammates will be able to call methods which are currently not implemented.
