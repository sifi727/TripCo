Planning Decisions the team made.

* On Friday we as team copied the tasks which were setup in the tripco repository. We then, discussed each task and then rated how complex we thought each task would be using the Fibonacci number sequence. Then, each member on the team chose the task(s) they felt comfortable completing by the end the sprint.

* Since this is the first time the team has worked together on a sprint we also met on Saturday and reviewed how the current code worked to help insure everyone was still comfortable with the tasks they had chosen on Friday. We also tentatively set a meeting for Wednesday after class because we knew the different parts of the code would need to work together and it is faster to figure out problems when we are physically together.

* On Wednesday we worked together and made decisions to revert changes which happen in auto generated files and we polished up the code before merging it into master.

## Retrospective

#### What went well

#### Potential improvements
* Figuring out the best way to mock out an object during the planning phase so other developers can use a method currently being built in the current sprint and still have their code compile.
* Reserving a room for our meeting would be beneficial so we can start the meeting on time and do not have to worry about if the equipment will work.

#### What we will change next time
* Reserving a room.
* Discuss ways to implement the code so teammates will be able to call methods which are currently not implemented.
