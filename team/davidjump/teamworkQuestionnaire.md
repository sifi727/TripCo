# Teamwork Questionnaire for _David Jump_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text and voicemail are easiest if there is something that needs to be addressed quickly. If it can wait, e-mail will work. Best time to reach me generally is 10am to 6pm. I have our class and a class Tuesday and Thursday from 11am to 12:15pm. I also have commitments different evenings so reaching me might be hard depending on the day.  After 9:30pm you probably won’t be able to reach me.

1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I am expecting that we will be able to design a working web app that fulfills the design specs.

1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to be able to improve my ability to communicate my ideas to the team and not be afraid of disagreements. In the past, I have been part of teams that only meet once a week and then go their separate ways. I want to help be part of a team that works together in a more inclusive manner.

1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Obstacles on communicating my ideas I might encounter is the fear of what others think. I don’t have much experience in Java, so I will tend to pull back because I will have doubt in my own abilities. This also leads into my teamwork goal as well, because when you doubt yourself there is a a tendancy to isolate yourself from wanting to work together.

1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Because we are supposedly graded on what we do individually and as team, people should work to strive for the grade they want.

1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Since the instructor is taking into consideration the amount of contribution to the project a person whose going for a ‘A’ would do more work, but I am interested to hear what others think.

1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 15 to 20 hours per person.

1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Starting out I think whoever has the most previous work/course experiences with the tools necessary to complete the work on the certain parts of the project should start on that part to insure a good base to start from. After this we as a group should allow others to take over these parts so people can learn and grow.

1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If it happens I think we as a group should talk about how this should not happen again. If it does happen again then we need to talk to our professor to come up with a viable solution.

1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We as a group need to discuss what is expected so we as a team know what is expected.

1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We will have to adjust to every one’s schedules and figure out the best time for each of us to work.

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes, I think we are going to need to touch base regularly to make sure we are all on the same page.

1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once to twice a week.

1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * What is the scope of the decision? If it is a major decision that is going to affect the whole project, then yes, so we can make sure to understand the full ramifications. If it is small with limited scope than no.

1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * First the people in the group need to make sure they understand the person’s point of view because we as team might have missed something. I would ask the other person if there is something they are missing on the other side. If not, then I would ask if they would be willing to go down this path. If they are adamite that they are not willing go down the path then I think we need to get some outside help.

1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * As a group talk with them. If they will not listen then talk with prof.

1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will tell the team that this is what I am feeling to see if there a solution to the problem. If there is not, then we will have to talk with prof.
